# Chat Emulator

The user opens the application and sees a green background. Messages are not displayed, and at the bottom there is a message saying "Enter message".

Random messages start coming into the chat. There are two types: one adds a message every 1 second, while the other adds a message every 2 seconds with a "+" added to the text. Keep in mind that new messages always appear at the bottom.

When typing a message, the keyboard appears and shifts the chat messages as shown in the layout, while the background remains unchanged. After sending the message, the keyboard closes. Remember that random messages should continue to come in.
